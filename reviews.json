    "body": "Town is a unique roblox FPS where you can build unique structures using f3x tools via a plot system. The game is fun depending on how much time your willing to sink on it, and your building skill. The game is fun, but with comes with free form content, comes some disturbing stuff. Over my 200+ hours of playing the game, I have been exposed to decapitated bodies at least 8 times according to my memory. Would I let a 9 year old play it? Hell no! If you are a teenager though, maybe under supervision. The game gets really fun at times, especially since you can build with your friends, and you can get exhilerated after killing people infront of a base, but overall, I would say the game is not worth dedicated everything and anything to. The staff members are allegedly pedophiles (take that with a pinch of salt) and do not actively moderate. There are 20+ staff members, and I have only seen them once or twice during my span of playtime. ",
